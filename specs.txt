SPECIFICATIONS!!

As a user, I want to create a task and be able to save a list of tasks, each one holding a text description.
As a user, I want to create categories to organize my tasks with a keyword or set of keywords being the name of the category. For example, the task "sweep the floor" could belong to the categories "work chores" and "kitchen chores".
As a user, I want to be able to assign a task to multiple categories.
As a user, I want to be able to assign multiple categories to a single task.
As a user, I would like to view all tasks associated with a single category, and all categories associated with a single task.
As a user, I would like to edit existing tasks and categories once they have been created and stored.
As a user, I would like to be able to delete existing tasks and categories, one at a time or all at once.
As a user, I would like to have a page to view all tasks and a page to view all categories.


IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:

Create classes with full CRUD functionality for Task and Category.
Task should have a 'description' property. (string)
Category should have a 'name' property. (string)
They should each be stored in tables named 'tasks' and 'categories' in a database 'to_do' with a test database 'to_do_test'.
A Category has many tasks. A Task has many Categories. This will be a many-to-many relationship.
There will also be a join table called categories_tasks holding columns 'task_id' and 'category_id' (both int)
